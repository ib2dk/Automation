  Beth is an intelligent Telegram chatbot built for a real estate company. She acts as a virtual property advisor — qualifying leads, searching listings, booking property inspections, and logging every lead to a CRM automatically. No human intervention required.

## What   Beth Does

**Lead qualification**
The moment a client messages,   Beth collects their name, email, phone number, budget, preferred location, property type, and number of bedrooms conversationally — like a real agent would.

**Semantic property search**
  Beth searches a RAG-powered knowledge base built on Supabase Vector Store to find matching listings based on what the client actually describes, not just keywords.

**Property images in chat**
Matching listings are sent directly inside the Telegram conversation with images, no external links.

**Live calendar availability**
  Beth checks Google Calendar in real time and offers available inspection slots to the client.

**Inspection booking**
Once the client picks a slot,   Beth creates the Google Calendar event and sends a confirmation email with property details and the assigned agent's contacts.

**Voice note support**
Clients can send voice notes instead of typing.   Beth transcribes them using Groq Whisper and processes them as normal messages.

**Automatic CRM logging**
Every qualified lead is saved to Google Sheets automatically — name, email, contact number, budget, property preferences. The agent wakes up to an updated CRM.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud)
- Telegram Bot Token (via BotFather)
- OpenAI API key
- Groq API key
- Supabase project with `documents` table and pgvector enabled
- Google account (Drive, Sheets, Calendar, Gmail)

### Environment Variables / Credentials to configure in n8n
```
- Telegram API credential
- OpenAI API credential
- Groq API credential
- Supabase API credential (URL + service role key)
- Google Drive OAuth2
- Google Sheets OAuth2
- Google Calendar OAuth2
- Gmail OAuth2
```

### Supabase Setup
Run this in your Supabase SQL editor to create the vector table:
```sql
create extension if not exists vector;

create table documents (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  content text,
  metadata jsonb,
  embedding vector(1536)
);

create index on documents using ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops);
```

### Knowledge Base
Upload property documents, FAQs, and listing data as PDF or text files to your configured Google Drive folder. The RAG pipeline detects new uploads automatically and indexes them into Supabase.

## Key Design Decisions

**Session memory keyed to Telegram chat ID**
Each conversation maintains context using the user's Telegram chat ID as the session key — so every user has their own isolated memory thread.

**Voice note pipeline**
Telegram sends voice notes as `.oga` files. The workflow converts them to `.ogg` before passing to Groq Whisper for transcription, then standardises the output to match the text message format before hitting the agent.

**RAG over hardcoded listings**
Property data lives in a vector database rather than being hardcoded into the prompt. This means the knowledge base updates automatically when new documents are added to Google Drive — no workflow changes needed.
